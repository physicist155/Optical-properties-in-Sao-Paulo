# Optical properties of atmospheric aerosols in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo

 This repository is meant to archive and provide public access to the data analysis and simulations I performed during my undergrand reaserch project as a student in the Atmospheric Physics Laboratory of the University of Sao Paulo (<a href="https://lfa.if.usp.br/home">LFA USP</a>). This project was proposed and supervised by Professor Luciana V. Rizzo.

- Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis of optical properties measurements in two brazilian cities, Diadema and Campinas, both located in the state of Sao Paulo. The data was acquired during a PhD project of a former member of LFA, one can find the article about it <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8761-2021">here</a>.
- Simulations:
